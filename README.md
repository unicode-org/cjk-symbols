Also included in this project is a TrueType (aka TTF) version of the font that is necessary for Unicode code chart production. The vast majority of its glyphs are derived from [*Source Han Serif*](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif/), specifically the Regular weight.

The latest pre-built binary version of the font, in both OTF and TTF formats, can be easily downloaded from the [Latest Release](https://github.com/unicode-org/cjk-symbols/releases/latest/).

This font began to be used as a replacement code chart font in [Unicode Version 14.0](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/), and the [Glyph and Variation Sequence Changes](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-14.0/#GlyphChanges) table on the [Unicode® 14.0 Versioned Charts Index](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-14.0/) page indicates which particular blocks, among those listed above, were updated to use this font.

## Building the fonts from source

### Requirements

To build the binary font files from source, you need to have installed the [Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko/) (AFDKO) tools. The AFDKO tools are widely used for font development today, and are part of most font editor apps.

### Building the fonts

In this repository, all necessary files are in place for building the name-keyed OpenType/CFF and TrueType fonts, and the *build.sh* file can simply be executed.
